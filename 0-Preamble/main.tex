%This report gives an overview of the work completed for Honours Project 2099: Autonomous Platform for Landmine Detection. 

Landmines are indiscriminate weapons responsible for injuring thousands of civilians and military personnel every year. Current demining methods employed by groups such as the Australian Defence Force are inefficient and place operators at great risk. The major motivation for this project was to reduce this risk, and also to increase the speed of demining operations by reducing false positive detections. In collaboration with the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG), an autonomous and unmanned platform with a multisensor system for landmine detection was proposed as a solution. 

The primary objectives of the project were to modify a platform for automation, develop software for automation and basic navigation, navigation of user defined paths, and for landmine detection and classification, and to mount sensors on the platform. The extended objectives were to develop an accompanying tablet application, to provide a live video feed to the operator, and to physically mark the location of landmines. A scenario of operation was developed, outlining the operating environment and basic performance specifications for the platform and sensors. The scope of the project was limited to a proof of concept design.

Benchmarking was initially conducted to explore currently available platform and sensor options, and to better understand what the major challenges associated with the project would be. As part of the literature review, the development of techniques for signal processing, sensor fusion, automation and navigation were explored.        

A conceptual design process was undertaken to select subsystems and commence designs based on the requirements from the scenario of operation. A metal detector and ground penetrating radar were chosen to form the sensor suite, and a quad bike supplied by the DSTG was selected as the platform, since it already had the framework for automation implemented. Based on the chosen platform and sensors, design requirements and concepts were formed for the sensor mount. The final design for the sensor mount was chosen to provide minimal interference to the sensors while maximising the signal to noise ratio obtained. Preliminary tests with the sensors were used to identify metrics that could characterise landmines. The pure pursuit method was chosen for path tracking as it was most appropriate for the conditions expected to be encountered by the platform. For the electronics systems, an Arduino microcontroller was chosen to handle low level automation functions, while a desktop computer was selected as a central unit handling all communications and signal processing. 
%Development of software architecture for project. 

As part of the detailed design process, the ideas developed in the conceptual design were further refined. Algorithms for signal processing of sensor data were developed, as well as for sensor fusion. Modifications were to made to key platform subsystems, namely the steering, brakes, gear, and positioning subsystems. An Extended Kalman Filter was used to fuse data from several positional sources, providing a positioning system with the necessary accuracy. Software for navigation and automation were developed, and preliminary testing was carried out in a virtual environment. A tablet application was also developed, allowing an operator to control the platform remotely and map data to or from the platform. A structural and vibrational analysis of the sensor mount was performed, after which the mount was manufactured. The mount was made from structural pine, with two steel supports for added support and stiffness. Due to the requirement to use non-metallic materials near the metal detector, nylon rods and perspex sheets were used to hold the metal detector in place.    

Testing was carried out to ensure that all subsystems were functioning as intended. Sensors tests were performed in two soil types with dummy landmines and clutter objects, and the data collected was used to build a database of metrics for automatic target identification. Tests of the positioning and other quad bike systems were also carried out, resulting in the fine tuning of electrical control subsystems. Initially, communication difficulties resulted in unpredictable behaviour from the Arduino, which led to safety concerns regarding platform operation. To prevent possible damage to the sensor suite, integrated systems test are yet to be conducted. 

An overview of the various management aspects of the project, including the work breakdown structure and Gantt chart, risk management and the budget, is provided. All of the primary objectives, namely platform automation,  software for basic and user defined navigation, software for the sensor systems, and the design of the sensor mount have been completed. Of the extended objectives, a tablet application has been developed, however the provision of a live video feed and physical marking of landmine locations have not been implemented, presenting the opportunity for future work.
