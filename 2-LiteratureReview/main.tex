\chaplabel{literatureReview}
This chapter provides a summary of the benchmarking process, as detailed in \Chapref{benchmarking}, and presents the literature review, which covers the areas of signal processing and sensor fusion, as well as navigation.

\section{Benchmarking}
Metal detectors are the most widely used sensor for manual landmine detection. While they are simple to operate, they are limited by the variety of landmine types they can detect. They also produce a large number of false positives, leading to demining operations being inefficient \parencite{minelabF3}. Another type of sensor that is increasingly used for manual landmine detection applications is the ground penetrating radar or GPR. These sensors allow small variations in density beneath the soil surface to be detected, meaning GPRs can be used to find metallic and non-metallic targets \parencite{sakaguchi2014}. However, this sensitivity makes it difficult to identify detected objects, especially in certain soil types. Multisensor systems, which for instance combine a metal detector and a GPR, allow the limitations of the individual systems to be addressed, leading to improved landmine detection performance \parencite{Takahashi10}. Whatever the sensor used, signal processing is an important requirement, particularly for the GPR. In the case of a multisensor system, sensor fusion must also be employed to consolidate the data from the individual sensors to provide meaningful output.  

An alternative to manual landmine detection methods is vehicle or platform based landmine detection. There are a wide variety of platform types used, a growing number of which have remote control or autonomous operation capabilities \parencite{portugal2014}. The selection of platform type largely depends on the sensor payload and scenario of operation. Key challenges regardless of the platform used include automation of the system, encompassing hardware and the control system, and navigation, which could have varying levels of complexity depending on the features to be implemented. 

\section{Signal processing}
As identified through benchmarking, signal processing is a major challenge associated with landmine detection. As part of the project, the outputs from both a metal detector and a GPR must be processed. 
\seclabel{splitreview}

\subsection{Metal detector signal processing}
A metal detector utilises a transmitting source and a receiving device to detect subsurface objects. The transmitted signal typically has a frequency of 1 to 100 kHz, and induces eddy currents in underground metallic objects \parencite{bruschini2000phase}. These eddy currents in turn generate a secondary magnetic field, at a greatly reduced amplitude, which can then be detected by the receiving coil of the metal detector. The signal to noise ratio obtained is often low, especially in heavily mineralised soils, and all signals are heavily attenuated with depth \parencite{Candy2008}. The signal also varies with the type of metal, and the size and orientation of the object.

Commercially available metal detectors convert the received signals directly to an audio signal, allowing an operator to distinguish different metal objects from the amplitude and tone of the received signal. Using this method, qualified demining personnel can readily locate the position of a subsurface object. However, full classification of the object or determination of its characteristics, such as size, shape and material, are practically impossible \parencite{Kruger2006}.

A more appropriate method for landmine detection is direct processing of the received signal. The first step in this is the preprocessing of background signals to improve the signal to noise ratio and remove soil and clutter effects. Common methods include removal of a minimum signal \parencite{bhatia2000sensor}, removal of an average signal \parencite{bruschini02}, threshold-based  filtering \parencite{tran2009evaluation}  and ground compensation by comparing the obtained signal to some reference or background signal \parencite{Kruger2006}. Each method has its limitations, since they may not be suited to certain landmine types, or they may be prone to errors. 

After preprocessing, data from a metal detector is most commonly represented as a phase plot, in which the signal is plotted in the the complex plane \parencite{Kruger2006}. The phase plot signatures for several example objects are shown in \Figref{signature}, demonstrating the variance in signature between objects.

\caption[Phase plot signatures of various subsurface objects]{Phase plot signatures of various subsurface objects in the complex plane, with the two loops corresponding to different frequency signals  \parencite{Kruger2006}}
\figlabel{signature}
\end{figure}

A phase plot is capable of uniquely identifying an object type to a certain degree, which allows for objects to be easily classified and hence identified \parencite{bruschini02}. The method is also reasonably robust against depth based attenuation, allowing the classification of objects irrespective of depth \parencite{Kruger2006}. This result is shown in \Figref{comp-signature}, where the same target produces the same phase plot at varying depths. \Figref{comp-signature} also highlights the importance of pre-processing as discussed above.
\begin{figure}[ht]

The top row shows the raw phase plots and the bottom row shows the phase plots after ground compensation, and the two loops in each image correspond to different frequencies \parencite{Kruger2006}} \figlabel{comp-signature}
\end{figure}

A notable failure of the phase plot method is that signatures of nearby objects can cause interference, reducing the likelihood that a correct identification will be made\parencite{Kruger2006}. This is particularly problematic for large metallic objects, which can completely obscure the signature of smaller objects. As a result, this technique is limited to situations in which metallic contamination is sparse, or metallic objects are typically an order of magnitude smaller than the objects of interest.

\subsection{GPR signal processing}
\seclabel{gpr}
Ground penetrating radars operate by transmitting radio signals and measuring the strength of reflected signals, caused by changes in density at the interface between objects and the soil. Typically the transmitted signals have a frequency from 50 MHz to 10 GHz \parencite{Ho2008}. Achieving a high signal to noise ratio is a challenge with a GPR, as signal noise is introduced at all locations where even a small change in density occurs. Furthermore, signals may be heavily attenuated depending on the frequency, soil type, moisture level and object type \parencite{Annan20091}. The unprocessed output from a GPR scanning an anti-personnel mine is shown in \Figref{GPRsample}, where the A-scan is the result of a stationary scan and the B-scan is obtained by scanning in a line. The solid line in \Figref{GPRsample} (b) represents the air-ground interface.

\begin{figure}[htp]

\end{tabular}}
\caption[Sample GPR response over buried anti-personnel mine]{Sample GPR response over a buried anti-personnel mine. An A-scan (a) is obtained from a stationary measurement, while a series of A-scans obtained by scanning in a line can be compiled (b) to form a B-scan \parencite{lee00}} 
\figlabel{GPRsample}
\end{figure}

By increasing the power of the transmitted signal or increasing the gain on the receiving signal, the effects of ground attenuation can be reduced, allowing for greater scanning depth with a GPR \parencite{Ho2008}. However, increasing the receiver gain also has the effect of amplifying any noise generated through the system. Therefore, a trade-off exists between the maximum sensing depth and the detection resolution  \parencite{shresta2003}. A solution to this is wideband frequency coverage, which makes use of the fact that different frequencies experience different levels of attenuation. By collating detection results from multiple frequencies, a combined response can be created, which has signal responses from large, deep objects while retaining the ability to distinguish small objects at shallow depths \parencite{3dradarDXG}.

Typically there are three steps required to process GPR signals for landmine detection, \parencite{Ho.etal2004}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Preprocessing}: Background signal removal and clutter suppression.
\item \textbf{Initial detection}: Selection of all suspicious anomalies present in the scan.
\item \textbf{Classification}: Analysing the data and determining which of the suspicious anomalies have a high likelihood of being a landmine.
\end{itemize}
Signals are pre-processed in order to increase the signal to noise ratio, and methods used include Kalman filtering \parencite{torrione2006ground}, subtraction of an average signal \parencite{gader2000fuzzy} and subtraction of a background signal \parencite{ko2012gpr}. 

Initial detection and classification  requires determining a set of characteristics or metrics which suitably and uniquely identify the feature of an object of interest. These metrics are limited to those which can be accurately measured by the GPR device, and are commonly the size, shape and other physical aspects of the object \parencite{Ho2008}. The easiest way to detect an object is if the approximate response is previously known, such as from a model or training data set \parencite{Yarovoy2009}. Algorithms have been developed which identify pattern matches between a known expected response and the received response from the GPR. The most popular algorithm for this application is the inverse-matched filter, which is a mathematical convolution over the received signal to detect the presence of the expected response \parencite{Osumi1984}. 

More advanced algorithms are capable of producing results with greater accuracy when correlated with detection confidences from nearby samples. If a number of samples in a local area show high confidence in a detected object, the overall confidence that a detection has occurred increases when compared to an isolated positive detection. The hyperbola detection method identifies the hyperbolic shapes formed in a B-scan which can be seen in \Figref{GPRsample} (b), through the use of computer vision techniques such as edge detection and the randomised Hough transform \parencite{Xu1990}.

% These algorithms represent the initial detection stage of the processing chain. Further classification of objects to reduce false-positive testing is possible through artificial intelligence strategies such as neural networks or decision trees, which require extensive sets of training data to produce strongly confident results, or through the pairing of the GPR detection with detection confirmation from a secondary sensor, such as a metal detector.

\section{Sensor fusion for landmine detection}
The wide range of potential materials, shapes and burial depths of landmines, as well as the constraints of sensing technologies, means that single sensor systems are limited in their detection capacity \parencite{Yarovoy2009}. Sensor fusion allows access to a wider range of information about a particular subsurface object, in turn allowing detection of a wider range of objects with heightened confidence. 
%Two potential configurations exist - where a single sensor is used as a primary detector with confirmation provided by secondary sensor, and where both sensors are used concurrently and information from both detectors is processed simultaneously. Mutual processing of the data from both sensors is called sensor fusion. 
A common distinction is made between potential levels of sensor fusion \parencite{schavemaker2001depth}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Decision-level fusion}: Information from the sensors is evaluated individually and a decision is made (landmine or non-landmine) for each sensor. Confidence in the sensor's independent decision is compared against a decision vector to produce a final determination.
\item \textbf{Feature-level fusion}: Information from the sensors is produced from the raw sensor data individually. This information is then combined from all sensors to create a singular feature, with a single and final determination made against this feature. 
\item \textbf{Data-level fusion}: Data is combined from all sensors to produce a single set of information about the feature. A final determination is made against this feature.
\end{itemize}
Experimental trials suggest that all forms of sensor fusion are capable of producing significantly more accurate detection results with far fewer false-positive incidents than single sensor systems \parencite{Yarovoy2009}. \Figref{sensorFusionresults} shows this trend in regards to several decision-level sensor fusion methods. The false alarm rate and detection rate are plotted for three individual sensors in \Figref{sensorFusionresults} (a), while the same parameters are plotted for three decision-level sensor fusion methods in \Figref{sensorFusionresults} (b). It is evident that when employing sensor fusion, the false alarm rate for a given detection rate is much lower.

\section{Navigation}
\seclabel{navigationandautomation}
A major challenge associated with the automation of a platform is the development of software for control and navigation. An important aspect of this is how the platform tracks a path.

\subsection{Path tracking}
\seclabel{pathTrackingLitReview}
Path tracking uses location information from a positioning system to guide a vehicle along a pre-defined course. In theory, the path can be defined as a continuous function \parencite{Giesbrecht2005}, but this is inefficient in practice as functions for each path segment would have to be determined. Instead, a path is usually discretised and defined by a series of points, called waypoints  as shown in \Figref{pathDefining} where the continuous function if broken down into a series of points \parencite{Gilbert2003}. Such a path can either be described as lines connecting the waypoints or as a series of closely spaced waypoints \parencite{Giesbrecht2005} making makes it easier for computer algorithms.

\figlabel{pathDefining}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Geometric path tracking}
Geometric path tracking uses geometric relationships between a vehicle and a path to produce a control algorithm as a solution to the problem. Theories assume vehicles use the Ackermann method for steering \parencite{Lundgren2003}, so that a simplified steering model can be used for the geometry. This reveals a relationship between the steering angle and the curvature that the non-steering wheels will follow. Two of the most commonly used geometric vehicle models are Pure Pursuit and the Stanley method \parencite{snider2009}.

Pure Pursuit uses a path ``look-ahead'' distance to measure the future error between the vehicle and the path in real time \parencite{Lundgren2003}, which can then be steered to and corrected for. \Figref{purePursuitGeom} shows the geometry associated with Pure Pursuit at one point in time. It shows a goal point $(g_x, g_y)$ on the desired path at a specified look-ahead distance $l_d$ in front of the vehicle. The steering angle is calculated based on an arc that would connect the centre of the non-steering axle to the goal point \parencite{Samuel2016}. The calculation of the goal point is effectively adding a waypoint to the path at that point. When high curvatures are present in a path, the controller may begin to cut corners \parencite{Lundgren2003}, due to a look-ahead distance that would effectively skip this portion of the path. Lateral error on a path of constant curvature may also be experienced due to geometric controller characteristics which do not take into account the curvature of a path \parencite{snider2009}. However, Pure Pursuit provides a very robust tracking algorithm when discontinuous curvatures are present. In general, for more accurate tracking a short look-ahead distance should be used \parencite{Giesbrecht2005} but this will eventually result in oscillation. For smoother tracking a long look-ahead distance should be used \parencite{Samuel2016} but this will reduce precision but lower oscillation.
\begin{figure}[ht]

\end{figure}

%\nomenclature[S]{$(g_x, g_y)$}{Pure Pursuit model goal point}%

Unlike Pure Pursuit which is based on the future error, the Stanley method uses the current lateral error between the centre of a wheel's axle and the nearest path point \parencite{snider2009} as can be seen in \Figref{stanleyGeom}. The desired effect is that as the vehicle strays further from the path, the wheel's steering angle is amplified in an attempt to correct for the error. The Stanley method is very well suited to higher speed tracking \parencite{snider2009}, but can run into problems when curvature discontinuities are present in the path. The model sets the steer angle to the heading error \parencite{Giesbrecht2005}, which is calculated as the difference between the vehicle's heading and the instantaneous heading of the nearest point on the path, $\theta_e$. An extra term is used when the lateral error is non-zero which amplifies the steer angle to a new value of $\delta$.
\begin{figure}[ht]

\end{figure}

%\nomenclature[S]{$\theta_e$}{Stanley method heading error}%
%\nomenclature[S]{$\delta$}{Steering angle}%

Some limitations of geometric path tracking methods are related to the dynamics of a vehicle which are not present in the theory, namely the capabilities of a platform and its actuators \parencite{coulter1992}. Due to this, the method expects an instant response from elements such as the steering, which is an issue when high path curvatures are present or when the curvature of the path suddenly changes. As a result, the method cannot guarantee that the vehicle will follow a path as accurately as designed and at high speeds that vehicle may skid or tip \parencite{coulter1992}, resulting in a potential accident which is undesirable.

\subsubsection{Kinematic path tracking}
The kinematic model collapses a four wheeled vehicle into a two wheeled model \parencite{snider2009}, much like the geometric path tracking approach. The equations of motion for the simplified system are then used to relate the vehicle speed, change in heading error and change in lateral error to a user defined velocity and steer angle in path coordinates \parencite{Gilbert2003}. In practice, the same trade off between performance and stability is apparent as in the geometric models, tracking accuracy declines at high speeds due to neglected dynamics \parencite{snider2009}. This method is not as robust as Pure Pursuit and displays a similar behaviour to the Stanley method when discontinuities in curvature are present.

\subsubsection{Dynamic path tracking}
A dynamic model approximates the real dynamics of a vehicle \parencite{Gilbert2003}, which was one of the downfalls of the previous examples. Similar to the kinematic model, the vehicle speed, heading error and lateral error are related to a user defined velocity and steer angle in path coordinates. Even though the dynamics of the vehicle are included in this model, extreme path properties such as large changes in curvature can have a very large effect on the accuracy and efficiency of the path tracking \parencite{snider2009}. Discontinuities in the path still have a noticeable effect on accuracy, and the steady state lateral error is still present. However, in a more realistic scenario a dynamic path tracking method does show overall improvement \parencite{Lundgren2003}.

\section{Outcomes}
The literature review covered different methods for signal processing, sensor fusion and platform navigation. The phase plot signature method was found to be an effective way to characterise landmines in metal detector data, based on the metrics of phase angle and magnitude. GPR signal processing on the other hand is much more complicated, with the received signals being strongly affected by the soil conditions, thus highlighting the need for a preprocessing routine. Target characterisation can be achieved be analysing features of the A-scan or B-scan. Several methods were also explored for path tracking, with the Pure Pursuit method being the best suited to low speeds and discontinuous curvatures.
