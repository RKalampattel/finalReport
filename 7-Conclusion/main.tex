\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\chaplabel{conclusion}
This chapter discusses to what extent each of the project objectives has been achieved. In addition, recommendations are made for future work, and a conclusion is presented.  

\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Remember to update the objectives below if any changes are made to them in the introduction}}

\section{Outcomes}
The outcomes for the project are assessed against the primary and extended objectives, as outlined in \secref{projectGoal}.

\subsection{Primary objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Selection and subsequent modification of an existing platform for remote control via a handheld device}\\ 
A quad bike supplied by the DTSG was chosen as the platform for the project. After an evaluation of the existing hardware, the subsystems to be modified were identified. A new power supply was installed for the steering motor, while a linear transducer was installed to more accurately measure the position of the brake actuator. New linear potentiometers were also installed for the gear selector. The DragonBoard control unit was replaced with a more modern Arduino microcontroller, and the entire system was rewired. All subsystems were tested independently, and after the development of the tablet application, simultaneous tests were successfully conducted, resulting in full remote controllability. (\textcolor{red}{need to add more details here, I know I've missed a few things})   
%Necessary systems for control, such as throttle, steering, gear and brake actuation, and communication will be implemented on the platform. Each system will be tested separately to ensure that it functions correctly and is safe to operate remotely. Once all systems are operating independently, simultaneous operation shall be conducted with the aim to maintain controllability of the platform at all instances. Successful completion of this objective, once the platform is able to be operated remotely, is the first step towards full platform automation.  

\item \textbf{Modification of an existing platform to accommodate a metal detector and a GPR}\\ 
A sensor mount was designed based on the requirements of the available sensing equipment, and the constraints imposed by the platform. The minimum proximity of the metal detector and GPR dictated the length of the mount, while the distance to the ground for both sensors was kept as small as possible to maximise the signal to noise ratio. A structural and vibrational analysis was performed to ensure that the mount would be able to support the desired loads while isolating the sensors from the vibrations of the quad bike. The body of the mount was made from structural pine, while the supports were made from steel. Nylon rods were used to hold the metal detector in place, while allowing for its height to be adjusted.   
%A sensor mount will be designed and built so that it can attach to the platform and support the chosen sensors safely, while adhering to the operating requirements of both the platform and sensors. The most suitable design will be chosen from several concepts based on its ability to isolate the sensor suite and minimise sources of interference to the sensor output. On completion of this objective, the platform will be fully integrated with the sensor suite.

\item \textbf{Development of software for platform automation and navigation, allowing for the platform to travel autonomously under supervision from an operator}\\ 
After conducting a literature review, different methods for navigation were identified. Eventually, the pure pursuit method was selected for path tracking as it provided the best performance at low speeds and discontinuous curvatures, which were expected to be encountered. An Extended Kalman Filter was used to create a highly accurate positioning system, overcoming the limitations of a standalone GPS or IMU. After modification of the platform and the upgrade of control unit were completed, code for automation was developed and integrated intro the navigation software. A virtual platform was developed, enabling testing of the navigation and automation software in a controlled virtual environment. Testing of the software with the quad bike was also completed, leading to the tuning of the code....  
%Initially, automation and navigation software will be tested in a virtual environment, allowing for full simulation of operations in a risk-free manner. The outputs of this virtual platform will include the location, heading, and speed of the platform. On completion of objective 1,  the software and control systems will be integrated into the real platform, and further testing will be performed. After completing this objective, the platform will be fully autonomous.

\item \textbf{Development of software for detection and autonomous classification of subsurface objects, with a focus on reducing the number of incorrect identifications or false positives}\\ 
Initial tests with sensors were used to identify metrics that could characterise landmines. Based on the findings of the literature review, algorithms were developed to find these metrics from sensor data in real time. Extensive tests were performed using different dummy landmines and clutter objects in different soil types, which led to the development of a database of metrics. A sensor fusion algorithm was also developed, which allowed a final decision to made regarding an identified object, and presented a confidence interval on the likelihood of the object being a landmine. Testing of the sensor system while mounted on the quad bike remains to be completed.
%After initial testing, the output signals from the metal detector and GPR will be processed in real time. The results will be analysed with the aim of identifying suitable metrics that can be used to classify and differentiate various targets. A database of metrics will produced and used to identify the likelihood of a landmine being present. Operational trials will be conducted to test the effectiveness of the developed system. On completion of this objective, the sensor suite will be able to detect targets in real time.

\item \textbf{Logging of detected objects with GPS coordinates. Once an object has been located, its position will be recorded and transmitted to a handheld device used by an operator}\\ 
A tablet application was developed to allow an operator to control the platform remotely. Once integrated with the sensor system, it was expected that GPS coordinates of detected objects could be logged. Since the systems are yet to be integrated, this has not yet been completed.  
%The output from the detection software in objective 4 will also be made available, allowing the operator to make an informed decision about how to proceed. Once the sensor suite has integrated with the platform (objective 2) and the platform is fully autonomous (objectives 1 and 3), this is the final objective required to complete the project goal.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Extended objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Automatic traversal of a designated area enclosed by a user defined region}\\ 
The tablet application allows the operator to specify the path of the quad bike in two ways, either by selecting waypoints which define a path, or by selecting points which define the boundaries of a region. If the latter is chosen, the navigation software subdivides the region and generates a path to scan the area....
%Initially, single waypoint navigation will be conducted, requiring the platform to travel from one predefined point to another before coming to a stop. In this objective, waypoints enclosing an area will be used, requiring the platform to generate its own path to traverse the enclosed area. Software will be tested in a virtual environment before being implemented into the platform on completion of the primary objectives. Completion of this objective will extend the navigational capabilities of the platform, and make it easier for an operator to use. 

\item \textbf{Provision of a live video feed as well as live updates of vehicle location and direction to the operator's handheld device}\\ 
Live updates of vehicle location and direction can be seen on the developed tablet application, since it has been linked with the positioning system on the quad bike. A camera has been purchased and installed on the quad bike, enabling a live video feed to be seen by operator, however this is currently only possible using a third party application, not the tablet application.   
%While the operator will be able to view the location of the platform using a handheld device, a live video feed allows for greater visualisation of operating conditions. This would also provide a greater ability to detect and respond appropriately to unknown obstacles in the search area.

\item \textbf{Physical marking of landmine locations by the platform at the time of detection}\\ 
Due to time constraints, options for physical marking systems were not explored. However, this is not expected to be a difficult task, and is something that could be attempted in future.  
%GPS coordinates alone may not provide sufficient precision for identifying the location of landmines. An electromechanical system that physically marks the location would allow demining personnel to identify this location more clearly.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Future work}
There are several ways in which the project could be extended if it were to be continued in future. 

% Incomplete objectives
As mentioned in the previous section, several objectives are yet to be completed. Firstly, full integration of the sensor and platform needs to be done, after which detected objects can be logged. Physical marking of landmines and the addition a live feed to the tablet application are also possible tasks.

% Improvements to things we have done already
Improvements that can be made: more testing for sensors, brake actuator, wheel encoder

% New additions
Things that were outside of the current scope such as object detection (more complicated navigation), use arrays instead of line scan sensors, 

\section{Conclusion}
The authors have developed an autonomous platform for landmine detection, and successfully demonstrated its feasibility. The challenges associated with this process, and the methods used to overcome these challenges, have been outlined in this report. It is hoped that this information will be beneficial in developing the next generation of autonomous landmine detection platforms.
